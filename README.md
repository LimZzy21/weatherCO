React WeatherCO app used: "axios": "^1.7.2", "bootstrap": "^5.3.3", "dateformat": "^5.0.3", "geolib": "^3.3.4", "react": "^18.3.1"

ofc write all code in one service was bad idea, now i understanding that i need to create more services with more modules and boilerplate.

app also has one bug with search near cityes, but now i haven't enought time to fix it, may be do it later.

npm i //for install dependencies

npm start //for run
